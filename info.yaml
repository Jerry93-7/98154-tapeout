# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it.
#
# Here is an example: https://github.com/mattvenn/tinytapeout_m_segments/blob/main/info.yaml
#
# This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  description:  "Chip takes an 8-bit seed number as input into the Chip 
                 and outputs an 8-bit psuedo-random number on the output pins"      # Short description of what your project does
  how_it_works: "Seeds number is fed as input into the flip-flops of either a Fibonacci or Galois Linear Shift Register, 
                 8 shifts occur, where the output of one of the linear shift register's is stored in a SIPO shift register.
                 The value of the SIPO shift register is then stored in a normal register, and then fed through an AES S-box
                 to generate the final output."      # Longer description of how the project works
  how_to_test:  "Set reset pin high for one positive clock edge.  
                 Next positive clock edge set reset pin low, enable bit low, and set select and input pins to desired values. 
                 Step clock until you see valid pin go high, then the output random number will be the psuedo-random number generated.
